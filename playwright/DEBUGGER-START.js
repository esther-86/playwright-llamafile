// @noPiiBug,@piiBug,@bug
// 
// BEST PRACTICES:
// - On test-level (top-level) test code - don't have locator-specific items. Everything should be readable in English
// - Base test data on study information when possible (make test resilient to study config). For example, instead of specifying Site 2... Use a function that find another site not site x 
// - Only do UI when needed as part of test, else, use API
// - Put sharable/reusable code under API/Flows. thisTest is for test-data related... Think about reusability
// - Potential bug should have Bug? in comment for searchability
// - Have ESLint/prettier on so when save, code gets formatted
// - DON'T use hardcoded indexing and think about reusability and changes whenever possible
// - DON'T PASS IN thisTest, current to non-test level code - pass in expected value only (Remove thisTest parameter - it should pass in what it needs, not pass in thisTest)
// - Write test from the outside in (test level first, then refactor and generate test methods)
// - After initializeTestInfo, use thisTest.data instead of current
// - Use options to specify flow behavior. For example, add OE/submit clicking, etc.
// - tcs instead of thisTest in OE, PDF, and Email helpers because those functions only care about the tcs and shouldn't need to know about thisTest
// - Don't have create, actions, etc. in the flow... fillFormToCreateNewParticipant + create instead of createNewParticipant...
// - Have the OE + assertions + toDeletes be done at the top test level... but that means that the verification for the pop ups will need to be duplicated
// - When need to use text, try to find an image instead for localization purpose
// - Try to minimize parameters for test until it's needed
// - Don't use Env.ORG_NAME in code... pass in the orgName and use from thisTest.data.orgName most of the time to have same base for PII/NoPII org
// - If test is not about user/participant creation, don't do it via the UI (preconditions via API)
// - Check for code exists before adding
// - assertions/expects function starts with "verify" for easy find/replace
// - Retries at test level: https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/10825

// When you execute a test case in katalon, it start a driver instance of browser (not actual browser with all plugins & settings) . It is expected to work this wayâ€¦ Now if you want to use same active browser then this can be done only with chrome driver in katalon.
